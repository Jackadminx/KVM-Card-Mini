## Firmware flashing

### CH582

Press and hold the BOOT key while connecting to the computer with the USB cable, and then use [WCHISPTool](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/WCHISPTool_Setup_exe.html) to flash the firmware.![03](./Document/Images/03.jpg)

If you do not use the debugging interface, you do not need to turn on the two-wire emulation interface, i.e., step 6

### MS2109

The matching AT24C16 EEPROM is burned with an EEPROM programmer.
You can use a burn-in clip to burn in the power-down state of the board.

The firmware for the MS2109 is from the [Yuzuki HCC HDMI](https://oshwhub.com/gloomyghost/yuzuki-hcc) project, and changes to the device name can be realized by editing the firmware with the HEX file editor.
